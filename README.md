# ARPG-Project

The game takes place in the land called Volans. A grassland in the sky, and a small part of the world Orbis.

A calm world which recently went through a great divide at its core causing patches of the land and underworld to lose its hold from its previous place and float up into the sky.

The humans and creatures who once inhabited the greater world of Orbis now find themselves fighting for power and to conquer these small patches of land they’ve gotten stranded on.

They do so by claiming the altars which are scattered around the world so they can harness the power from their old home.
